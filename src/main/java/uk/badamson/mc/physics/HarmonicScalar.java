/**
 * <p>
 * A {@linkplain TimeVaryingScalar functor for a time varying scalar property}
 * that can have <i>damped harmonic</i> variation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class allows for a constant acceleration (second derivative), and thus a
 * quadratic variation in its value.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is tempting to allow for a linear variation of the acceleration (constant
 * <dfn>jerk</dfn>), and thus a cubic variation in its value. However, as for
 * all higher order polynomials, that would produce a variation that can become
 * infinitely large with time. That would be unrealistic, because in practice
 * all forces (accelerations) are self limiting. So the variation deliberately
 * does not allow for a cubic variation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class allows for <dfn>damped harmonic</dfn> variation; that is, a
 * decaying sinusoidal variation of its value. That also allows for
 * exponentially decaying and growing variation as a special case of zero
 * frequency of the sinusoidal variation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The timewise variation of the scalar is given by the expression
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * f(t) = f<sub>0</sub> + f<sub>1</sub>&tau; + f<sub>2</sub>&tau;<sup>2</sup> +
 * e<sup>&tau;</sup>(f<sub>c</sub>cos &alpha; + f<sub>s</sub>sin &alpha;)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * where &tau; = &omega;<sub>e</sub>(t - t<sub>0</sub>), and &alpha; =
 * &omega;<sub>h</sub>(t - t<sub>0</sub>), with t<sub>0</sub>, f<sub>0</sub>,
 * f<sub>c</sub>, f<sub>s</sub>, f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>2</sub>, f<sub>3</sub>,
 * &omega;<sub>e</sub> and &omega;<sub>h</sub> being constant parameters.
